App Link: https://bc5-group-l.herokuapp.com

The dashboard contains data updated in real-time, using yfinance
Predicted prices for each cryptocurrency are also included in the dashboard
We also performed a technical analysis to evaluate the momentum and the trend

In this project, it was asked to build a dashboard using any Python-based tool 
for Warner Buffer and Gil Bates, partners of Investments4Some, so it can be used by 
their financial analysts. This dashboard is expected to be flexible, fetching daily 
updated data about their crypto assets, and they expect to use it to inform the 
investment decisions of their internal financial team and external stakeholders. On the 
dashboard are included predictions on the cryptocurrencyâ€™s prices for the next day 
and, to keep the dashboard as complete as possible, two technical indicators were 
also included.
